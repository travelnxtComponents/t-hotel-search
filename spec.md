- You can use Google/Vaadin's elements (like calender element and textboxes etc.)
- You can use some Tavisca's elements like auto-suggest if required from https://github.com/atomelements/t-autosuggest but all the features and properties mentioned in scope should be added. (Fork the existing element and create V2)
- APIs Integration - Use Tavisca's APIs for integration purpose.

## Performance standard
- Any component if opened via [web page tester](https://www.webpagetest.org/), it should load under 500ms (milli seconds).
